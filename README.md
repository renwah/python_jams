# Python Jams

Materials for an one hour per week, eight week crash course in Python programming,
originally created as part of a summer data science fellowship. These lessons
assume a reasonably high-level of pre-existing technical sophistication but no
prior Python experience. Topics that will be covered include the basics of
Python programming (formatting, conditional flow, basic data structures), Pandas,
and interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

## Required Set-Up

Before starting this crash course, I recommend installing Anaconda (even if you
already installed Python separately). Anaconda is a Python distribution designed
with data science in mind and includes a number of useful features such as improved virtual environment management and package installation. You can download Anaconda [at this link.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section); please select the Python 3.X option.
